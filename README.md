# 1. About
 
 This program illustrates modular application dividied into 6 separate java modules introduced in JDK 9. 
 The application reads data from text files (initial files containg some example data: File, File1, File2 and File3 are localized in mainapp module), 
 validate the data and eventually convert the filtered data into one resultant json file.
 The json file is loaded then into app memory in order to calculate some statistics which can be choosen via application menu.
 The application utilizes Java 8 Stream API.
