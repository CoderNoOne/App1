# 1. About
 
 This program illustrates console modular application dividied into 6 separate java modules introduced in JDK 9. 
 The application reads data from text files (initial files containg some example data: File, File1, File2 and File3 are localized in mainapp module), validates the data and eventually converts the filtered data into one resultant json file.
 The json file is then loaded into app memory in order to calculate some statistics which can be choosen via the application menu.
 The application utilizes Java 8 Stream API.
